## Project Overview

A Colorado employee gave me the following tasks to complete an election audit of the recent local congression election 

1.Calculate total number of votes cast  
2.Get a complete list of candidate votes  
3.Calculate the total votes each candidate received  
4.Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won  
5.Determine the winner based on popular vote  

## Resources
-Data source= election_results.csv
-Python 3.7.6  Visual Code Studio version 1.52.0 (user setup)

## Summary

Total Votes: 369,711 were cast

The Candidates were  
Charles Casper Stockham  
Diana Degette  
Raymon Anthony Doane  

Charles Casper Stockham got 23.0% or 85,213 votes  
Diana DeGette got 73.8% or 272,892 votes  
Raymon Anthony Doane got only 3.1% or 11,606  

Clearly the Winner is Diana DeGette leading with 272,892 votes and a percentage of 73.8% of popular votes

## Challenge Summary  

The challenge was to create a python code for getting the total number of votes, the names of the candidates involved and the outcome of the voting data. 

During this experience of learning python, understanding the importance of "",(),{} and indentation was important. There are multiple lines with extra spacing in the code to make it neat and clear. It required understanding of some basic coding skills. The overall outcome was clear and concise .  
Overall outcomes show a winner, with % of votes to 1 decimal after and the number of votes.
